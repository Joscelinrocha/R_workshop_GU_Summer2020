```

## Joscelin is trying to teach you rmarkdown

This is an word document showing you how the document gets "knitted".

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## You can even include plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
