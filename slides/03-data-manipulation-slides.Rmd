# Tidyverse

---

![](images/tidyverse_celestial.png)
---

## Base R Syntax


--

```{r}
table(data$age,
      data$ed)
```

--

- In this example, table is our function and our data frame goes in the parentheses

--

- The dollar sign is used to specify the column or variable we want (data_frame$variable)

--

> Con: you have to refer to the database every time (annoying)

--

> Pro: there are thousands of add-on packages available for R at CRAN

---


## Tidyverse Syntax



```{r}
data %>% 
  tabyl(age, ed)

```

--

- This is the same as earlier but did you notice I only referred to my dataframe once?
--

- The pipes! (%>%). They chain together a series of functions

---

## The Pipe

.pull-left[![](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/369427/screenshots/4124541/pipe.jpg)]
.pull-right[![](images/conceptual-tidyverse-code.png)]

---

### The Pipe

I would read each pipe as "then." For example:

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(age < 25) %>% 
  group_by(ed) %>% 
  summarize(mean_gestation = mean(gestation, na.rm = TRUE))

```

### Your Turn


1. Open the 03-data-manipulation-exercises.Rmd file

--

1. Load the `tidyverse` package

--

1. Import the Child Health and Development Studies dataset: **`data/chds6162_data.csv`** to a data frame called **`data`**

--

1. I will walk you through some examples and then it will be your turn

--

1. These are the functions we will go over:

  <ol start=1>
  .pull-left[
  <li> select  
  <li> mutate
  <li> case_when
  <li> filter]
 
<ol start=5>
.pull-right[
<li> summarize
<li> group_by
<li> across
<li> relocate
]
